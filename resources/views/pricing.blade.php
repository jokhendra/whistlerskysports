If you're chasing extreme adventure, other outlets might better suit your vibe.

                    Average Learners (AL) are the heart and soul of our programâ€”folks just like us who've dabbled in sports at some point in their lives, from weekend soccer games to high school track. These learners move through life at a comfortable pace, embracing each moment as it comes. With solid reflexes and a cooperative spirit, they dive into training with enthusiasm and adaptability.

                    This is my favorite group, and here's why: ALs often become some of the finest pilots! They bring a grounded, respectful mindset to the cockpit, steering clear of reckless stunts or risky aerobatics. With a deep appreciation for safety, they handle the aircraft with steady hands, always mindful of their boundaries and the plane's operating limits. Their thoughtful approach makes them a joy to train and a credit to the skies.
